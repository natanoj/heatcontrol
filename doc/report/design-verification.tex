Each part of the system needs to be sufficiently verified before
manufacturing to ensure that no major bugs exist. Verification for
each part of the system will be described in the following sections.

\subsection{Hardware verification}
\input{design-ver-hw}

\subsection{Embedded software verification}
\input{design-ver-emb-sw}

\subsection{Operator software verification}
\input{design-ver-oper-sw}
