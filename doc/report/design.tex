The system will consist of hardware, embedded software and optional
software running on a separate computer system for adjusting
parameters and monitoring the system. Each part of the system design
will be described in the following sections.

Design of the hardware components of the system is separated into
different pieces to reduce complexity in the design process. The
following pieces are designed seperately: main control unit, floor
heating control unit and room unit.
